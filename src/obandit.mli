module WrapDoubling (B : Bandit) : Bandit
(**This functor wraps a bandit algorithm with the
  doubling trick. This means that all rewards are rescaled according to a scale
  (initially, 1). When a value is observed above the scale, the bandit
  algorithm is restarted and the scale is doubled.  This is useful when reward
  scale is unknown and larger than 1.*)
